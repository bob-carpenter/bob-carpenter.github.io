## Selected publications


### Stan

I'm best known for Stan.  This is the top-level systems overview paper.

> Carpenter B, Gelman A, Hoffman MD, Lee D, Goodrich B, Betancourt M, Brubaker M, Guo J, Li P, Riddell A. 2017.  [Stan: A Probabilistic Programming Language.](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v076i01) *Journal of Statistical Software.* 2017 76(1).

I also wrote the bulk of the language user's guide and reference manual.

> Stan Development Team. 2021. [*Stan Language User's Guide.*](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/index.html) [*Stan Language Reference Manual.*](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/index.html)

I developed the first version of our automatic differentiation library, which I documented here;  it's come a long way since then.

> Carpenter, B., Hoffman, M.D., Brubaker, M., Lee, D., Li, P. and Betancourt, M. 2015. The Stan math library: Reverse-mode automatic differentiation in C++. *arXiv* 1509.07164.

### Bayesian Metodology

This paper gathers a bunch of thoughts on how we actually fit models; we have a contract to turn this into an open-access book with CRC.

> Gelman, A., Vehtari, A., Simpson, D., Margossian, C.C., Carpenter, B., Yao, Y., Kennedy, L., Gabry, J., Bürkner, P.C. and Modrák, M., 2020. Bayesian workflow. *arXiv* 2011.01808.

### Applied Statistics

Recent work on adjusting for non-representative samples with noisy testing.

> Gelman, A. and Carpenter, B., 2020. [Bayesian analysis of tests with unknown specificity and sensitivity.](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rssc.12435) *Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C* 69(5).

I've spent a lot of time thinking about crowdsourced and "expert" data coding/labeling/annotation:

> Passonneau, R.J. and Carpenter, B., 2014. [The benefits of a model of annotation.](https://transacl.org/ojs/index.php/tacl/article/view/389) *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics* 2:311--326.

### Natural language and programming languages

My very first paper is indicative of things to come---it's really about data structures and an inconsisency I found in a draft of Gazdar et al.'s seminal book on GPSG.

> Gazdar, G., Pullum, G.K., Carpenter, R., Hukari, T.E. and Levine, R.D. 1988. Category structures. *Computational Linguistics* 14(1).

The culmination of the line of work that started was this book, which used domain theory to prove a bunch of theorems around logic programming data types.

> Carpenter, B., 2005. *The Logic of Typed Feature Structures: with Applications to Unification Grammars, Logic Programs and Constraint resolution. Cambridge University Press.

I also spent a lot of time applying types and linear logics in the form of Lambek-style categorial grammars to problems at the interface of natural language syntax and semantics.  This grew out of a course that everyone told me I could've only taught at CMU.

> Carpenter, B. 1997. *Type-Logical Semantics.* MIT press.
