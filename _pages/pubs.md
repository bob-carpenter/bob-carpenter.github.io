## Stan

I'm best known for Stan.  This is the top-level systems overview paper.

* Carpenter B, Gelman A, Hoffman MD, Lee D, Goodrich B, Betancourt M, Brubaker M, Guo J, Li P, Riddell A. 2017.  [Stan: A Probabilistic Programming Language.](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v076i01) *Journal of Statistical Software.* 2017 76(1).

I also wrote the bulk of the language user's guide and reference manual.

* Stan Development Team. 2021. [*Stan Language User's Guide.*](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/index.html) [*Stan Language Reference Manual.*](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/index.html)

I developed the first version of our automatic differentiation library, which I documented here;  it's come a long way since then.

* Carpenter, B., Hoffman, M.D., Brubaker, M., Lee, D., Li, P. and Betancourt, M. 2015. [The Stan Math Library: Reverse-mode automatic differentiation in C++](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07164). *arXiv* 1509.07164.

## Bayesian Methodology

This paper gathers a bunch of thoughts on how we actually do Bayesian data analysis and predictive inference; we have a contract to turn this into an open-access book with CRC.

* Gelman, A., Vehtari, A., Simpson, D., Margossian, C.C., Carpenter, B., Yao, Y., Kennedy, L., Gabry, J., Bürkner, P.C. and Modrák, M., 2020. [Bayesian workflow.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808) *arXiv* 2011.01808.

## Applied Statistics

Recent work on adjusting for non-representative samples with noisy testing.

* Gelman, A. and Carpenter, B., 2020. [Bayesian analysis of tests with unknown specificity and sensitivity.](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rssc.12435) *Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C* 69(5).

I've spent a lot of time thinking about crowdsourced and "expert" data coding/labeling/annotation:

* Passonneau, R.J. and Carpenter, B., 2014. [The benefits of a model of annotation.](https://transacl.org/ojs/index.php/tacl/article/view/389) *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics* 2:311--326.


## Natural language and programming languages

My very first paper was built up my fixing the typed data structures in Gazard et al.'s book.

* Gazdar, G., Pullum, G.K., Carpenter, R., Hukari, T.E. and Levine, R.D. 1988. [Category structures.](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J88-1001/) *Computational Linguistics* 14(1).

I kept at data structures for linguistics, eventually writing a whole book treating them as base types for logic programs.

* Carpenter, B., 2005. [*The Logic of Typed Feature Structures: with Applications to Unification Grammars, Logic Programs and Constraint Resolution.*](https://www.amazon.com/Logic-Typed-Feature-Structures-Applications/dp/0521419328) Cambridge University Press.

I worked on type theory, linear logic, and categorial grammars, which I brought together in this mongraph.

* Carpenter, B. 1997. [*Type-Logical Semantics.*](https://www.amazon.com/Type-Logical-Semantics-Language-Speech-Communication-dp-0262531496/dp/0262531496/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1612655482) MIT Press.
