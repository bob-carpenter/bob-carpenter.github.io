## Software

Please see [my open source software page](../software/).

## Publications

Please see [my publications page](../pubs/)

## Postdocs and Interns

I've had three Ph.D. students, Ariel Cohen (now a linguistics
professor at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev), Gerald Penn (now a computer
science professor at University of Toronto), and Kathy Baker (left
academia).  I've had numerous master's students, interns, etc.

If you're interested in postdoc positions or summer internships,
please contact me.

## Teaching

I taught two classes per semester in natural language processing,
computability and automata theory, psycholinguistics, semantics, and
the philosophy of language during the eight years I was at Carnegie
Mellon.  I've taught numerous summer school courses and short courses.

## Invited Talks

I really like giving talks, especially now that I'm no longer
teaching.  Please contact me if you'd like me to give a talk.


## Service

In addition to reviewing for open-access no-fee publications, I once
served on the editorial board for *Computational Linguistics*.
Nowadays, my service is largely in the form of code reviewing and
hiring.
